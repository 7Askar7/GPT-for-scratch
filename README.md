# **GPT**
 **This code is based on a video by Andrei Karpatov.**

      
## 1. First of all, we need to get unique characters and create lambda-functions 'encode' and 'decode'.

```python
# here are all the unique characters that occur in this text
chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
vocab_size = len(chars)
# create a mapping from characters to integers
stoi = { ch:i for i,ch in enumerate(chars) }
itos = { i:ch for i,ch in enumerate(chars) }
encode = lambda s: [stoi[c] for c in s] # encoder: take a string, output a list of integers
decode = lambda l: ''.join([itos[i] for i in l]) # decoder: take a list of integers, output a string
```

## 2. Second, create a function that generates a small batch.
```python
def get_batch(split):
    # generate a small batch of data of inputs x and targets y
    data = train_data if split == 'train' else val_data
    ix = torch.randint(len(data) - block_size, (batch_size,))
    x = torch.stack([data[i:i+block_size] for i in ix])
    y = torch.stack([data[i+1:i+block_size+1] for i in ix])
    x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device)
    return x, y
```
## 3. Now let's consider our **Attention**.
### **What`s problem with Attention?**
  - Attention is a communication mechanism. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.
  - There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.
  - Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never "talk" to each other
  - In an "encoder" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with tril, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a "decoder" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.
  - "self-attention" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In "cross-attention", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)
  - "Scaled" attention additional divides wei by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below
```python
class Head(nn.Module):
    """ one head of self-attention """

    def __init__(self, head_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.key = nn.Linear(n_embd, head_size, bias=False)
        self.query = nn.Linear(n_embd, head_size, bias=False)
        self.value = nn.Linear(n_embd, head_size, bias=False)
        self.register_buffer('tril', torch.tril(torch.ones(block_size, block_size)))

        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x):
        B,T,C = x.shape
        k = self.key(x)   # (B,T,C)
        q = self.query(x) # (B,T,C)
        # compute attention scores ("affinities")
        wei = q @ k.transpose(-2,-1) * C**-0.5 # (B, T, C) @ (B, C, T) -> (B, T, T)
        wei = wei.masked_fill(self.tril[:T, :T] == 0, float('-inf')) # (B, T, T)
        wei = F.softmax(wei, dim=-1) # (B, T, T)
        wei = self.dropout(wei)
        # perform the weighted aggregation of the values
        v = self.value(x) # (B,T,C)
        out = wei @ v # (B, T, T) @ (B, T, C) -> (B, T, C)
        return out
```
### **Multi-Head Attention**
```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    """ multiple heads of self-attention in parallel """

    def __init__(self, num_heads, head_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.heads = nn.ModuleList([Head(head_size) for _ in range(num_heads)])
        self.proj = nn.Linear(n_embd, n_embd)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x):
        out = torch.cat([h(x) for h in self.heads], dim=-1)
        out = self.dropout(self.proj(out))
        return out
```
## 4. Feed Forward.
- This photo explain why we use ```4 * n_embd```

```python
class FeedFoward(nn.Module):
    """ a simple linear layer followed by a non-linearity """

    def __init__(self, n_embd):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(n_embd, 4* n_embd),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(4 * n_embd, n_embd),
            nn.Dropout(dropout),
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)
```
